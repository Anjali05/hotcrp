Version 2.23   22.Jul.2008

* Do not infinite loop when sending mail to non-ASCII names associated with
  long email addresses.  Reported by Robbert van Renesse and Rich Draves.

  review ratings are enabled.  Reported by Robbert van Renesse.

* Correct PHP warnings and make compatible with older PHPs.  Reported by
  Jeonghee Shin.


Version 2.22   15.Jul.2008

* Appearance fixes: use default controls in most cases.

* Aggregated information about review ratings are provided on the PC
  details page.

* Allow searches of review fields and scores.  For example, "ove-mer:2>=2"
  searches for papers that have at least 2 overall merit scores that are
  greater than or equal to 2.  Requested by Rich Draves and Robbert van
  Renesse.

* Support multiple-choice paper options (rather than checkbox).  Requested
  by Jeff Mogul.

* Improve some messages and help text.


Version 2.21   11.May.2008

* Further improve validation and Internet Explorer 6 compatibility.


Version 2.20   11.May.2008

* Improve Internet Explorer 6 compatibility.  Reported by Terence Kelly.
  Includes Drew McLellan's supersleight for transparent PNG support
  (http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6).

* Some validation fixes.

* Set MySQL's max_allowed_packet on a per-session basis based on PHP's
  upload_max_filesize, rather than relying on users to set
  max_allowed_packet correctly.  A problem was reported by Sourabh Jain.

* Bug fixes to preference list, English, and createdb script.


Version 2.19   6.May.2008

* Provide visible feedback on Ajax forms.

* Improve manual assignments page with better conflict listings (Rebecca
  Isaacs).


Version 2.18   5.May.2008

* Record PC feedback about whether reviews were helpful.  PC members and,
  optionally, external reviewers can rate one another's reviews.  Hopefully
  this will help improve the quality of reviews.  "Was this review helpful
  for you?" appears above each visible review.  HotCRP reports the number
  of ratings for each review and how many of those ratings were
  positive. It does not report who gave the ratings, and it never shows
  rating counts to authors.

* The $Opt["emailSender"] option lets you set the envelope sender in sent
  mail (Robbert van Renesse).

* Add review tokens, which allow reviewers to edit reviews anonymously.

* Prettier styles.

* Bug fix: Correct commenter identities in comment emails.

* Finish (?) information exposure fixes (David Andersen).

* Banal works with pdftohtml 0.36 (Robbert van Renesse).

* When a paper is withdrawn, its reviewers no longer need to complete their
  reviews (Stefan Savage).


Version 2.17   23.Apr.2008

* IMPORTANT: Continue reviewer identity leak fix via search rewrite.

* Rewrite search again.  Search now works like Google search.  "-word"
  excludes "word" matches from the search.  "word1 OR word2" searches for
  either "word1" or "word2" (the OR must be uppercase).  The default search
  box returns papers that match ALL the words.  Searches in title,
  abstract, and authors match whole words, not portions of words.  The
  process of building up and executing a query is cleaner and comes closer
  to the ideal of returning all visible information.

* Paper lists report "0" reviews for papers that never got a review (rather
  than "0/1").


Version 2.16   21.Apr.2008

* IMPORTANT: Reviewer identity leak fix.

* Improve usability with tooltips and appearance improvements (inspired by
  John Wilkes).

  submission period has not closed.  A warning informs them that authors
  can still update.

* Show SHA-1 checksums for paper submissions (Dave Andersen).

* Download: Review forms (zip) returns a .zip with a separate review form
  file for each form (Jeff Mogul).

* Display "Your discussion leads" link even before "PC can view all
  reviews" is set (Brad Beckmann).

* Bug fix: Fix manual chair assignment page (Mark Gebhart).

* Bug fix: Fix review form download from the review page (Mark Gebhart).

* Bug fix: Do not reveal author names to reviewers when authors withdraw a
  paper already under review (Stefan Savage).

* Bug fix: "Reviewers" user search returns reviewers that completed reviews
  for papers that have since been withdrawn.

* Bug fix: Authors can see review form guidance.

Version 2.13   22.Jan.2008

  loads by reporting the correct Content-Length for gzipped content
  (problem reported by Elliott Karpilovsky).

Version 2.12   30.Dec.2007

Version 2.7   23.Aug.2007

* Email notification for comments.  Authors, reviewers, and PC members can
  request email notification when comments are added to a paper they are
  interested in.  The system tracks a global preference and per-paper
  preferences, so one can say "no notifications in general, but notify me
  about paper 4".  Notification is on by default.  Requires schema changes;
  see the file 'Code/updateschema.sql'.

* PC members and reviewers can view a paper's comments before they finish
  their own reviews for that paper.

* Reviews have a "The review is ready for others to see." checkbox, instead
  of "Submit" vs. "Save changes" pushbuttons.  The checkbox is a better UI.
